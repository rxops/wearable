# Wearable + SDK – Healthcare IoT Concept

**Stack:** Rust (embedded + cross-platform via Tauri/C-FFI) + SurrealDB (embedded) + Candle (if compatible)

**Hardware Baseline:**

* **MCU:** XIAO ESP32C6 (dual-core Cortex-A55, Wi-Fi/BT, Linux-capable)

* **Sensors:** MAX30102 PPG (SpO₂ + HR),
  optional 6-axis IMU, skin temp, GSR, barometer etc

---

## Vision

A modular, network-aware wearable platform for continuous vital-sign monitoring, early warning scoring, and tele-consultation. Devices can operate standalone, mesh with peers, or offload connectivity to a nearby phone or hub. Target use cases: chronic disease follow-up, hospital-at-home, sports rehab.

---

## 1. Core Sensing

* SpO₂ ±2%, HR ±3 bpm (MAX30102)
* Motion artifact cancellation via IMU fusion
* Expandable: temperature, GSR, barometer

---

## 2. Networking Model

Wearable ↔ Wearable (BLE Mesh) ↔ Phone / C6 Bridge ↔ Cloud

* Nodes broadcast summaries to peers
* Nearest bridge (phone / C6 puck) handles LTE/Wi-Fi uplink
* Cloud is stateless (MQTT/WebSocket); bridges tunnel packets upstream

---

## 3. Firmware Foundation

* Zephyr RTOS + NimBLE (or FreeRTOS bare-metal)
* MAX30102 driver + bio-algo (HRV, arrhythmia, calibration)
* TinyML (TensorFlow Lite Micro) for anomaly scoring
* OTA/DFU over BLE

---

## 4. Mobile / Bridge SDK

* Flutter / Xamarin-MAUI plugin for wearable discovery + gRPC/REST APIs
* Raspberry Pi option for headless bridge mode
* Rules engine (Node-RED style) for no-code alerts

  > Example: HR >120 bpm for 3 min → push notification

---

## 5. Cloud Microservices

* **Ingest:** MQTT broker (EMQX) + TimescaleDB
* **Processing:** Apache Flink (real-time), DuckDB (offline)
* **API:** GraphQL + OIDC + FHIR façade
* **Dashboard:** React + Plotly, Twilio/SMS hooks

---

## 6. AI / Analytics

* Personalized baseline drift detection
* Sleep staging (PPG + IMU)
* A-fib classifier (irregular R-R intervals)
* Cohort trend explorer for clinicians

---

## 7. Privacy & Compliance

* End-to-end AES-GCM, BLE LE Secure, WPA3
* Hardware-rooted keys via C6 TrustZone/OP-TEE
* Data residency zoning + anonymization for research

---

## 8. Deployment Scenarios

* **Hospital-at-home:** bedside hub uploads continuous streams
* **Care homes:** multiple pods mesh to one ceiling bridge
* **Sports rehab:** coach tablet sync in real time, offline-capable

---

## 9. Developer Resources

* Reference repo: KiCad hardware, firmware submodules, Dockerized cloud
* Jupyter notebooks for analytics
* Sample HL7/FHIR messages for EMR testing
* Community hub: pinouts, calculators, compliance guides

---

## 10. MVP Checklist

1. MAX30102 + LIS3DH IMU → ESP32C6 via I²C/SPI
2. Zephyr + NimBLE + battery gauge + flash buffer
3. Flutter app bridging MQTT → cloud
4. Grafana dashboard: live HR/SpO₂ + threshold alert
5. OTA update demo: push tachycardia detection model

---

**Outcome:**
An open, mesh-ready framework for diverse healthcare and performance-monitoring applications—COPD management, fall detection, post-op recovery, or sports analytics—without reinventing connectivity, security, or cloud infrastructure.

Would you like me to **make it even shorter (pitch-deck style, 1–2 lines per section)**, or keep this **technical but streamlined version**?
