## Project Goals

The primary goal is to build a functional prototype of the wearable health monitor, focusing on a complete hardware architecture that integrates sensors effectively. The design emphasizes cost-effectiveness for easy adaptation in commercial healthcare environments, ensuring it can fit various needs without high expenses.

Key objectives:
- Develop a generic, adaptable hardware setup that works across different healthcare scenarios.
- Prioritize sensor roles and data accuracy for reliable monitoring.
- After prototyping, design and fabricate a custom PCB with SMD modules for optimized production and scalability.

## Healthcare Challenges & Our Approach

### The Challenge
Traditional health monitoring often relies on bulky, expensive devices that are not suitable for continuous, everyday use. Many people lack access to affordable tools for tracking vital signs like heart rate, oxygen levels, and temperature at home or on the go. This leads to delayed detection of health issues, higher healthcare costs, and limited ability for doctors to monitor patients remotely.

### Our Approach
Our wearable health monitor is a small, lightweight device that continuously tracks key health metrics using simple sensors. It connects wirelessly to phones or the internet, sending data securely to healthcare providers or apps. The device is easy to wear, powered by a long-lasting battery, and comes with a software kit that makes it simple for developers and healthcare systems to integrate the data.

### Expected Outcomes
By providing affordable, continuous health monitoring, this device can help catch health problems early, reduce hospital visits, and improve patient care. It empowers individuals to take control of their health, supports remote patient monitoring for better outcomes, and lowers costs for healthcare systems. In the long term, it can contribute to better public health by enabling data-driven insights and preventive care.

## Use Cases & Applications

The wearable supports various healthcare scenarios by leveraging collected data for monitoring and alerts:

### Managing Chronic Conditions
- Tracks vital signs for long-term illnesses, enabling early interventions and reducing hospital visits.

### Home-Based Care
- Monitors recovery at home, providing real-time data for virtual check-ups and timely alerts.

### Senior Care
- Detects falls and vital sign changes in elderly settings, ensuring quick responses.

### Medical Research
- Collects objective data for clinical studies, helping evaluate treatments.

### Remote Healthcare
- Shares data with doctors during virtual visits for better diagnosis and care planning.

These applications demonstrate the device's versatility in preventive and specialized care scenarios. The accompanying SDK helps developers build connected health solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing healthcare infrastructure.

## Data Collection & Processing

### Sampling Strategy & Signal Processing
The device employs intelligent, adaptive sampling to capture critical health changes while optimizing power consumption and data quality.

**Core Approach:**
- Continuous or adaptive sampling of HR, SpO‚ÇÇ, and temperature with motion-informed filtering
- HRV derived from cleaned inter-beat intervals (time-domain: RMSSD, SDNN; frequency-domain optional in host/cloud)
- Activity classification initially basic (rest/active) using accelerometer magnitude variance

### Sampling Rates & Processing Windows

|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| PPG (IR/Red) | 50‚Äì100 Hz | 5‚Äì8 s sliding | 5 s HR/SpO‚ÇÇ | Heart rate & blood oxygen |
| Skin Temperature | 0.2‚Äì1 Hz | 60 s median | 60 s | Body temperature monitoring |
| Motion/Accelerometer | 25‚Äì50 Hz | 4 s | 4‚Äì10 s activity | Activity detection & artifact filtering |
| Battery Monitor | 0.016 Hz (1/min) | N/A | 60 s | Power management |

### Adaptive Power Management
**Energy Optimization:**
- Adaptive downscaling when vitals are stable (e.g., night mode) to save energy
- Motion-aware sampling adjustment based on activity level
- Intelligent duty cycling to extend battery life

### Signal Quality & Artifact Filtering
**Noise Reduction Techniques:**
- Band-pass filtering (0.5‚Äì5 Hz) for PPG signals
- Motion-correlated segment rejection for heart rate accuracy
- Interpolation of short signal gaps to maintain continuity
- Real-time data quality scoring and flagging

This smart sampling ensures the device captures important health changes without overwhelming users with excessive data or draining the battery unnecessarily.

| Audit | Immutable append-only audit log for data access & alert modifications |
| Regulatory Considerations | HIPAA (US), GDPR (EU) principles (minimization, consent, deletion workflow) |
| Secure Boot / Firmware | Signed firmware images (future) + version attestation |

Threat Surface Mitigations:
- Replay prevention: nonce + timestamp in batch envelope
- BLE pairing with passkey or numeric comparison
- Rate limiting / anomaly detection for API keys

## Testing & Validation

| Layer | Method |
|-------|--------|
| Sensor Signal | Controlled bench tests with optical tissue simulators / temp plates |
| Algorithm | Synthetic waveform injection + golden HR/SpO‚ÇÇ traces |
| Firmware | Unit tests (filter windows, HRV calc), power profiling scripts |
| Cloud API | Contract tests (OpenAPI), load tests for streaming sessions |
| Data Quality | Compare against clinical-grade reference (pulse oximeter, thermometer) |

Calibration Strategy:
- Initial LED current sweep per user during pairing
- Temperature offset calibration vs ambient + skin contact settling (first 3‚Äì5 min)
- Motion artifact model refinement with labeled activity sessions

Quality Metrics: Missing sample %, artifact rejection rate, drift vs reference, uptime.
