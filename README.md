### Data Collection
The device continuously gathers key health metrics in real-time: heart rate, blood oxygen levels, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity data. These non-invasive measurements enable proactive health management.

## System Integration

To build an effective wearable system, components must work together smoothly for data flow and communication:

* **Sensor Connection**: Sensors link to the microcontroller using standard interfaces, enabling coordinated data gathering. The processor converts raw data into useful health metrics.
* **Wireless Features**: Includes Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for short-range and internet-based data transfer. Bluetooth connects to nearby devices like phones, while Wi-Fi allows direct cloud uploads.
* **Power Efficiency**: Optimized energy use keeps the device running longer on battery power, with smart modes for continuous monitoring.
* **Data Processing**: The microcontroller combines inputs from sensors into organized data packets for reliable transmission.
* **Network Expansion**: For multiple devices, wearables can connect in networks or through hubs that relay data to cloud services or healthcare platforms.

This setup creates reliable data pathways from the device to user applications.

## Software Development Kit (SDK)

The project includes an SDK for easy integration with other systems:

* **APIs**: Access real-time and historical health data.
* **Data Formats**: Supports standard formats like JSON and HL7 FHIR.
* **Security**: Secure authentication to protect data and comply with regulations.
* **Libraries**: Tools for common programming languages to embed data.
* **Customization**: Configure alerts and behaviors for specific needs.

The SDK helps build connected health solutions.
