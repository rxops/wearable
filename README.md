# Wearable – Healthcare IoT+SDK Concept

**Stack:** Rust (embedded + cross-platform via Tauri/C-FFI) + SurrealDB (embedded) + Candle (if compatible)

**Hardware Baseline:**

* **MCU:** XIAO ESP32-C6 SoC (dual-core Cortex-A55, Wi-Fi/BT, Linux-capable)

## Vision

A modular, network-aware wearable platform (band form-factor) for continuous vital-sign monitoring, early warning scoring, and tele-consultation. Designed for chronic care follow-up, hospital-at-home, and wellness use cases.

---

## 1. Core Sensing

* SpO₂ ±2%, HR ±3 bpm (MAX30102)
* Skin temperature monitoring (MAX30205)
* Lightweight motion filtering (no IMU required)

---

## 2. Networking Model

Wearable ↔ Wearable (BLE Mesh) ↔ Phone / C6 Bridge ↔ Cloud

* Nodes broadcast summaries to peers
* Nearest bridge (phone / C6 puck) handles LTE/Wi-Fi uplink
* Cloud is stateless (MQTT/WebSocket); bridges tunnel packets upstream

---

## 3. Firmware Foundation

* Zephyr RTOS + NimBLE (or FreeRTOS)
* MAX30102 & MAX30205 drivers + bio-algo (HRV, arrhythmia detection, calibration)
* TinyML (TensorFlow Lite Micro) for anomaly scoring
* OTA/DFU over BLE

---

## 4. Mobile / Bridge SDK

* Flutter / Xamarin-MAUI plugin for wearable discovery + gRPC/REST APIs
* Raspberry Pi option for headless bridge mode
* Rules engine (Node-RED style) for no-code alerts

  > Example: “SpO₂ < 90% for 5 min → push notification”

---

## 5. Cloud Microservices

* **Ingest:** MQTT broker (EMQX) + TimescaleDB
* **Processing:** Apache Flink (real-time), DuckDB (offline)
* **API:** GraphQL + OIDC + FHIR façade
* **Dashboard:** React + Plotly, Twilio/SMS hooks

---

## 6. AI / Analytics

* Personalized baseline drift detection
* Sleep/wellness insights from PPG patterns
* A-fib classifier (irregular R-R intervals)
* Cohort trend explorer for clinicians

---

## 7. Privacy & Compliance

* End-to-end AES-GCM, BLE LE Secure, WPA3
* Hardware-rooted keys via C6 TrustZone/OP-TEE
* Data residency zoning + anonymization for research

---

## 8. Deployment Scenarios

* **Hospital-at-home:** bedside hub streams vitals continuously
* **Care homes:** multiple bands mesh to one ceiling bridge
* **Wellness/Sports rehab:** sync to coach tablet in real time, no cloud needed

---

## 9. Developer Resources

* Reference repo: hardware (KiCad), firmware submodules, Dockerized cloud stack
* Jupyter notebooks for analytics
* Sample HL7/FHIR messages for EMR integration
* Community hub: pinouts, power-budget calculators, compliance checklists

---

## 10. MVP Checklist

1. MAX30102 + MAX30205 → ESP32C6 via I²C/SPI
2. Zephyr + NimBLE + battery gauge + flash buffer
3. Flutter bridge app (MQTT → cloud demo)
4. Grafana dashboard: live HR/SpO₂/Temp + threshold alert
5. OTA update demo with anomaly detection model

---

**Outcome:**
A streamlined **band-style wearable + SDK** framework for healthcare and wellness—COPD monitoring, post-op recovery, chronic care, or fitness analytics—without rebuilding connectivity, security, or cloud services.
