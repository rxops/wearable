# Wearable - Healthcare Wearable IoT Concept  

Hardware baseline:  
• Seeed Studio C6 MCU board (dual-core Cortex-A55, Wi-Fi/BT, Linux-capable)  
• MAX30102 PPG sensor (SpO₂ + HR) on a fingertip or wrist pod  

High-level vision:  
Create a modular “network-aware” wearable that can operate alone, daisy-chain with other wearables, or delegate cloud connectivity to any nearby phone / hub. The platform targets continuous vital-sign monitoring, early warning scoring and tele-consultation for chronic patients and post-hospital follow-up.

1. Core biosensing capabilities  
   • SpO₂ ±2 % accuracy, resting HR ±3 bpm via MAX30102  
   • Motion-artifact cancelation through 6-axis IMU fusion  
   • Optional: skin temperature, GSR (stress), barometer (altitude compensation)  

2. Multi-tier network topology  
   wearable ↔ wearable (BLE-Mesh) ↔ mobile / C6 hub ↔ cloud  
   a. Wearable nodes broadcast low-rate summaries to neighbours.  
   b. Nearest phone or dedicated C6 “bridge puck” maintains LTE/Wi-Fi backhaul.  
   c. Cloud is stateless MQTT/WebSocket; each bridge tunnels packets upstream.  

3. Firmware skeleton (ready-to-dev)  
   • Zephyr RTOS + NimBLE, or bare-metal with FreeRTOS; board files for C6.  
   • MAX30102 driver, Bio-algo library (HRV, SpO₂ calibration, arrhythmia flag).  
   • TinyML edge models (on-device anomaly scoring) compiled with TensorFlow Lite Micro.  
   • DFU/OTA over BLE for field upgrades.  

4. Mobile / bridge SDK  
   • Xamarin-MAUI or Flutter plugin to auto-discover wearables, expose gRPC or REST.  
   • Optionally run on a Raspberry Pi if a phone is unavailable—headless bridge mode.  
   • Edge rules engine (Node-RED style) to build no-code alerts: “HR > 120 for 3 min → push notification.”  

5. Cloud micro-services  
   • Ingest: MQTT broker (EMQX) + TimescaleDB for high-resolution vitals.  
   • Processing: Apache Flink job for real-time scoring; offline pipelines in DuckDB.  
   • API: GraphQL gateway, OpenID Connect auth, FHIR façade for EHR integration.  
   • Dashboard: React + Plotly, configurable care-team panels, Twilio/SMS hooks.  

6. AI / analytics modules  
   • Personalized baseline drift detection (e.g., teach system “my normal SpO₂ is 93 %”).  
   • Sleep staging from PPG + IMU.  
   • A-fib classifier flagged by irregular R-R intervals from PPG.  
   • Population-level trend explorer to aid clinicians in cohort analysis.  

7. Privacy, security & compliance  
   • End-to-end AES-GCM, BLE LE Secure Connections, WPA3 STA for bridges.  
   • PKI with hardware-rooted keys in C6’s TrustZone/OP-TEE.  
   • Data residency zoning; pluggable anonymization service for research datasets.  

8. Field deployment scenarios  
   • Hospital-at-home: each patient wears pod; bedside C6 hub uploads continuous streams.  
   • Group-care home: multiple pods mesh to a single ceiling-mounted bridge.  
   • Sports rehab: athletes sync to coach tablet in real-time, no cloud if offline.  

9. Developer & community assets  
   • Start-to-finish reference repo: hardware KiCad files, firmware submodules, Docker compose for cloud.  
   • Example notebooks (Jupyter) for quick analytics on exported CSV.  
   • Sample HL7/FHIR messages for EMR round-trip testing.  
   • Public Slack / Discourse with hardware pinouts, power-budget calculators, compliance checklists.  

10. MVP build checklist  
   1. Strap-on MAX30102 + LIS3DH IMU board → C6 dev board via I²C/SPI.  
   2. Implement Zephyr + NimBLE + battery gauge + on-device flash ring-buffer.  
   3. iOS/Android Flutter app bridging MQTT to cloud demo.  
   4. Grafana dashboard with live HR/SpO₂ card + threshold alert.  
   5. OTA update proof-of-concept; push new model to detect tachycardia.  

Outcome: A flexible, open, “mesh-ready” framework that developers can fork for COPD monitoring, elderly fall detection, post-op vitals, or sports analytics—all without rewriting connectivity, security or cloud scaffolding.
